## This is basic application which shows how to use React Hooks
### React hooks used :

- useState
- useContext
- useEffect
- useReducer

##### With hooks I have created a `<Provider />` component which can be use to link between the data or let's be precise a state object, which can be accessed by its children components and can be updated by using `useReducer` hook.
